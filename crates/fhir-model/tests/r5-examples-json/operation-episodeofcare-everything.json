The response is a bundle of type \"searchset\". At a minimum, the episodeofcare resource itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has available for the given episodeofcare for the user. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, locations, organizations etc. The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their record, or to allow a client to retrieve everything for an episodeofcare for efficient display).\r\rThe server SHOULD return all resources it has that:\r\r* are included in the episodeofcare compartment for the identified episodeofcare (have a reference to the episodeofcare)\r* are referenced by the standard extension for associating an episodeofcare (where no reference element exists) http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-episodeOfCare\r* the server believes are relevant to the context of the episodeofcare for any other reason (internally defined/decided)\r* any resource referenced by the above, including binaries and attachments (to make a more complete package)",
